Ideas for improvements to the Edit Source extension:

* Add block highlighting.
* Add code folding.
* Add an HTML/CSS/JS tidy feature. This could be done using the HTMLTidy library.
* Add support for viewing the rendered output of opened-from linked articles by opening a new tab or window for them.
* Add support for opening local documents into the editor.
